# Placeholders (Git-managed)

- Purpose: minimal, safe images used when user assets are missing.
- License: self-generated/CC0-grade solids; no third-party content.
- Formats: PNG only. Size targets are 256x256/512x512; current files are tiny solids for safety.
- Size guard: keep each file under 1MB.
- Do **not** place real character assets here; use `data/assets_user/...` for real usage.
